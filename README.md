# Simple Todo App

A simple Todo app for logging tasks with due dates and marking them completed. Designed to be lightweight and flexible so it can be used as a CLI tool, a small web app, or a component inside a larger project.

## Core idea

Store tasks with a title, optional description, a due date, and a completed flag. Let users add new tasks, view tasks (optionally filtered/sorted by due date or completion), edit or delete tasks, and mark tasks as completed. Optionally surface reminders or notifications for upcoming due dates.

## Key features

- Add tasks with title, optional description, and due date.
- List tasks with due-date and completion status.
- Mark tasks as completed (and optionally restore to incomplete).
- Edit or delete tasks.
- Filter and sort tasks (e.g., overdue, due today, upcoming).
- Persist tasks (JSON/localStorage/DB depending on deployment).
